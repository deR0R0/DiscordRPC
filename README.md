A simple python program that changes your discord rich presence/game activity. 

Disclaimer!!!: This program uses your IP to determine your **nearby** location for the weather mode. Nothing is stored/sent to my end. :)

The program will bug you about it though... D:

## Use

But, if you would like to use it with python, the libraries are down below.

- pypresence
