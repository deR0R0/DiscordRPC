A simple python program that changes your discord rich presence/game activity. 

Disclaimer!!!: This program uses your IP to determine your **nearby** location for the weather mode. Nothing is stored/sent to my end. :)

The program will bug you about it though... D:

## Creating a Custom RPC

1. Create a application at the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

2. Name the application and create it (your discord status will be set as this application name!)

3. Copy the application ID and paste it into the prompt

6. Large Image & Large Image Text (If large image -> large image text (required) if not large image then no text)

Go to the tab "Rich Presence" and go to "Art Assets" and upload an image (size has to be 512x512 and max is 1024x1024)

(i will not be doing this for the sake of this tutorial)

7. Small Image & Small Image Text (same as large image, just a smaller image üëç and small image has to be with large image)

8. Button

Enter the button text and the url it will redirect you to when you click it.


Congrats, you are done! You may save if you would like (or not)
